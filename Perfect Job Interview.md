## 11.Preparing Your Resume
**Here are a few key things to keep in mind when creating your résumé:**
1. Make it clear and simple (avoid full sentences for responsibilities) 
2. All key information should be easy to see 
3. Leave out irrelevant details (don't include unrelated jobs) 
4. Make sure spelling and punctuation are 100% perfect! 
5. Using templates is ok

There are many ways to create a résumé, and many styles are acceptable. It's generally better to use a simpler format in order to avoid distractions.
One website for finding résumé templates is: resume.com/sample

## 14. Scheduling Your Interview
In your follow-up call, you may initially speak with a secretary or front-dest person. Regardless, state your reason for calling, give your name, and ask to speak with the appropriate person.

> [!Info] Here are some ways to explain the purpose of your call: 
> Hello. This is..., and I'm calling about a résumé I submitted a few days ago for the... position. Could I speak with the HR manager, please? 
> 
>Hi there. My name is... I'm just calling in regards to the... vacancy listed on... dot com. Could you confirm whether the vacancy is still available?
>
> Hello, I am calling because I sent in my résumé a few days ago for the... position opening and just wanted to follow-up. Could I speak with the HR department manager? 

Once you are speaking with the right person, confirm that the résumé was received and request an interview.

> [!info] Here are a few ways to confirm and ask for an interview: 
> I'm wondering if you've had the chance to look over my résumé. I sent it on Tuesday afternoon.
> 
> I just wanted to confirm that you've seen my résumé, and I'd also like to reiterate my interest in the position. I think I would be a really good fit for the job.
> 
> I'm just calling to follow up on the résumé I sent in several days ago, and also to ask whether or not it would be possible to come in for an interview. I believe that I'm well-qualified for the position.
> 
> I submitted my résumé on... dot com because I saw that you are currently hiring for a... manager position. I wanted to follow up and make sure that you had received it. Once you've had the chance to review it, I would love the opportunity to meet face-to-face for an interview

## 17. Preparing for the Interview 
##### Things to do before:
###### Research
Ensure that you know basic details about the company, including general size, the founding date, the company mission/philosophy, and if possible, what about the company separates it from other companies in the market. Two good sources for such information are Glassdoor and Wikipedia.
###### Clothes 
As a general rule, it's important to be well-groomed and dressed appropriately, depending on the nature of the company (this should be part of your research). Remember that what you're wearing often provides the first impression, and first impressions are powerful.

For more casual employment, don't overdress. This would include companies like startups, which may not hire someone wearing formal attire (it's against the culture). You might search 'casual interview attire' in advance.

However, for more traditional office positions, do not wear jeans or athletic shoes. Again, this depends on the position. More senior-level positions generally require 'formal attire' (research examples online, as fashions change over time).
###### Time 
Arrive exactly 30 minutes before the scheduled interview time. Arriving too early could come across as overly eager. Arriving too close to the scheduled time may suggest carelessness.

##### Things to keep in mind:
###### The Handshake
Use a firm grip, but not too hard. A loose grip, in American culture, shows weakness. This is called a 'dead fish' and giving one may cost you the job. This is true for both women and men. Do not hold the handshake for more than 2 or 3 seconds. Make eye-contact throughout.
###### Small Talk
If there is the opportunity to discuss your trip to the interview place or something discussed over the phone or by email, don't avoid it. Showing a willingness to have small talk shows an ability to get along well with others. That said, don't tell long stories or go into excessive detail.
###### Humor 
If you are funny, don't resist being funny. If you aren't, don't pretend that you are, as this will create awkwardness. The most important thing to remember in an interview is to be yourself. Don't try to be what you think the interviewer would like you to be, in terms of your personality. Being genuine is the best chance you have to make an impression, and your professional qualifications are not the only consideration for the interviewer
###### Body Language 
Sit up straight. Do not slouch. Don't avoid eye contact, and yet don't stare. Generally speaking, it's best to keep both feet on the floor, but this also depends on the type of job you're applying for. More casual companies will not be so particular about posture.

## 18. Making a Good Self-Self-Introduction
##### Tips: 
- Do not script and memorize your introduction
- Generally, don't freestyle (unless you are good at that)
- Before the interview, come up with a simple outline of things you'd like to talk about
##### Example outlines:
- Name and education 
- Work experience and interests
- Values related to work
- The connection of skills and values to this job
**OR**
- Name and reason for applying
- Work experience and connection to this job
- Interests that show a good characteristic

> [!Info] Self-introduction example:
> As you can see on my resume, my name is Luke and I studied philosophy at Miami University of Ohio. A lot of people say that philosophy is not a great major because you can't exactly get a job in philosophy job, but I don't think that's right. Philosophy teaches you how to think. There have been many occasions throughout my adult life that would have turned out much differently without logical and analytical thinking, which is what my focus in university provided me.
> 
> Another thing. My character, skills, and career so far have really been shaped for the better by much of my previous work experience. Actually, most of my previous jobs have involved dealing with people on a daily basis. Whether it was teaching yoga, interviewing people for articles as a journalist, or working in a museum to ensure guest satisfaction, difficult situations arose and had to be handled with delicacy and empathy. I feel I've come a long way in my ability to deal with people, no matter the situation, and those abilities and honed characteristics have earned me the respect and trust of my previous colleagues and employers. This gives me a lot of confidence in my qualification for this position. Managing hotel staff and providing excellent guest experiences is not easy, but I am wellprepared to handle whatever challenges I may face.

## 19. What are your strengths? 
##### Tip: 
When you talk about strengths, you want to avoid sounding arrogant, and you should also avoid simply talking through a long list of positive adjectives. Instead, provide one or two positive attributes that you feel other applicants may not possess, then give specific examples to support them. The examples you provide are just as important as the characteristics you're explaining.
##### Useful Phrases:
- I’m trying to be objective..., but I would say...
- I think my past co-workers would say... 
- I think I’m quite… For example... 
 
For modesty: One personality trait which has really helped me in the past is…

> [!Info] Example answer:
> Well, I would say that I'm quite good at handling high-pressure situations, which has been critical for me in some of my past jobs. For example, when I worked as a customer service representative, I had to deal with a lot of angry customers all the time, shouting at me over the phone and sometimes in-person.
> 
> Added to this, I was often the go-between for the customer and the tech support specialist, which meant even more pressure. One of the things which helped me excel in that position and earn regular 'top specialist' awards, was my ability to remain calm no matter what was happening.
> 
> Believe it or not, there were times when 5 people were shouting at me at the same time and asking me to complete a step or confirm something 'right now'. By learning how to maintain a sense of empathy and at the same time detach my more immediate or basic emotions, I was able to handle the problem very effectively, whereas most of my colleagues and even my supervisor would get pretty upset and often frazzled whenever customers got frustrated. Regulating emotions is key here. So, I think through this experience, in particular, I became really good at dealing with intense situations, and that has come in handy many times since.

## 20. What are your weaknesses?
##### Tip: 
Don’t go out of your way to make yourself look bad. Don't kill your chances of getting the position by saying something so negative it's clear to the interviewer that you're the wrong choice. Instead, talk about something very specific that you’re 'not great at', and then focus on what you're doing to improve that particular thing. Maybe you’ve already made progress toward turning it into a strength!
##### Useful ways to express weakness:
- I’m not great at…
- I could definitely improve my…
- I lack experience in… 
- I have the tendency to…
**BUT**
- I’m hoping here I can work on these things.
- I believe I have a clear path forward.
- I’ve already come a lot way.
- I’m improving in this area constantly.
- I’m really focused on turning this into a strength.
##### Don't forget to always return to core things:
- what are your best qualities
- what makes you a good fit for the job
- why are you more qualified than others

> [!Info] Example answer:
> I'm not really great at keeping records. I know it's important, but sometimes I just forget to do it, and I realize that can lead to miscommunication and organizational inefficiency. I'm working on it. I'm trying to improve this about myself. In fact, I've recently enrolled in an online course on personal finance, which I think has already given me some of the tools to help me succeed.

## 29. Questions About Experience
##### How to answer these questions: 
When sharing experiences, don't get lost in pointless details. Of course, it is essential to provide specific examples, but if you say too much about something that doesn't reflect an ability to deal with the skills required for this job, the interviewer will probably think you're just 'off track'. Don't get off track. Don't dwell on details that mean nothing. In every answer, you're showing the interviewer what makes you a good fit for the job.
##### What did you learn from your last job? 
Tip: 
Choose something that can be applied to the position you're applying for. If you learned how to use Photoshop in your last job but that doesn't have anything to do with this position, don't talk about it.

> [!Info] Sample Answerr:
> In my last job, when I was working as a teacher in a language center, some lower-level students had a hard time understanding the native speakers, and they would get discouraged. Sometimes I had to spend a whole hour explaining a single point. I used to get frustrated but then started putting myself in their shoes, which allowed me to focus more on the goal of learning, rather than how many times I had to say something. Empathy became a way for me to learn greater patience. I realized that patience is the greatest tool for any teacher. The funny thing is that when I was more patient, the students tended to get it faster because they were relaxed. This created a really positive learning environment that also helped them build confidence.
##### Why are you leaving your current job? 
Tip: 
Don’t be negative. Never say that you're leaving because you can't stand something about where you're working now. Instead, focus on the positive reasons for leaving. Is it time for you to take the next step? Are you ready for a change? Are you looking for new skills? Do you want to make a bigger impact? Be positive, no matter what.

> [!Info] Sample Answerr:
> I've decided to leave my current job because I want to continue to develop my career, and I believe I have to go elsewhere to do that. I can only learn and grow so much where I am because there aren't many opportunities. It's a pretty small company. I am grateful for everything I've learned there, but I'm also driven by a passion for personal growth, new challenges, and broader horizons.
##### Talk about a time when you had to deal with conflict.
Tip: 
Remember that whatever stories you share should reflect something about your personal characteristics or abilities. Avoid focusing too much on the conflict. Explain it quickly, then focus on the solution. Say what you did to resolve it.

> [!Info] Sample Answerr:
> I had a huge disagreement with Cheryl about how we should be interpreting our sales data from Q1. We were really at an impasse; we even started shouting at each other during one meeting. I realized we weren't going about it the right way, and we'd have to hammer out a direction that we could both get behind (support). I invited her out for lunch and we talked for over two hours.
> 
> It was a more casual setting, and I think both of us were a bit more relaxed and ready to listen to the position of the other. By the end of our discussion, we were finally on the same page, and in fact, I realized that Cheryl's thinking was closer to the best short-term strategy, whereas I had been thinking years ahead. Here's what I learned from that. I learned that listening rather than arguing solves a lot of problems. I also realized that the best outcomes are the result of mutual respect and real discussions.
##### Describe something difficult you’ve had to overcome. 
Tip: 
This is a great chance for you to talk about personal achievement. Consider sharing something that shows how you used your best skills and characteristics. Again, don't focus too much on the problem.

> [!Info] Sample Answerr:
> For a year I worked for almost no salary, as an intern. I was working 60 to 70 hours a week, and I was exhausted. But in the end, it was worth it. I ended up getting a great position at the same company, and I already had colleagues I knew and a strong reputation, so it was a real boost to the start of my career. During that year I learned a lot about myself. I learned that I can do almost anything if I set my mind to it. I realized that struggle is largely mental, and that overcoming difficulty means keeping a positive mentality--seeing the glass half full--and focusing on learning, doing quality work, and building strong relationships. I think a lot of people decide they can't do things before they do them. The battle is over before it begins. You can't do that. The right attitude is key, and you don't know what you can't do unless you try something truly hard first.
##### Have you ever had to take the lead? 
Tip:
This does not require you to have management experience. 'Taking the lead' could include any time when you've had to step up and control the situation. Focus on the positive characteristics that particular experience reflects about you, and perhaps, what you learned from it.

> [!Info] Example answer:
> Oh, when I was in university I decided that there should be bike lanes in the university, because riding alongside cars is actually quite dangerous, and I bicycled around campus a lot. I proposed a demonstration and announced it in the campus community forums. Part of organizing that involved getting everyone's contact information, and ensuring that everyone involved had their hearts in it. I have to say, my emails were pretty persuasive as well, which is partly why so many people showed up.
>

I have to say, my emails were pretty persuasive as well, which is partly why so many people showed up.
> 
> A newspaper reporter came and wrote an article about it. She interviewed me because I had arranged the whole thing, and later I attended a campus board council meeting, as a representative of the students. I had to explain our case to the school and city officials, including points and arguments I had collected from the protestors. So, because I took the lead on this, actually a couple years later, bike lanes were introduced. I'm not sure it was only because of me, but I think I played a part.
##### Discuss your educational background. 
Tip: 
Generally, the interviewer will have your resume right in front of them. Don't just say what is there. Instead, focus on the valuable things that you gained from your education, or things you achieved.

> [!Info] Example answer:
> I learned discipline in university, I learned how to make myself do something from beginning to end, and finish it by a particular deadline. That's something that doesn't get discussed about higher education, but it was really valuable for me in that way. Also, for me, there were rewards along the way to help me stay focused on grades. Learning to sit down and read an entire book or stay in to study when others were going out to party is what helped me get onto the Dean's list every year.
> 
> That has carried into my adult life and career. I'm able to accomplish tasks and work effectively when others may get distracted. I think because this job is so demanding, my unwavering discipline makes me a pretty good fit.
##### What was your biggest failure?
Tip: 
The interviewer does not know what your real biggest failure is. The point of this question is to share a failure and what you learned from it. The one you choose should not be so bad that it prevents you from getting the job. It should be serious enough but mostly focused on your valuable takeaways from the experience.

> [!Info] Example answer:
> When I was 22 I had to take a huge exam for a kind of certification. Only 10% of people pass the exam. It's really difficult. So, I studied for months and months, and the day finally came. I was ready, I thought, but then I failed. I couldn't believe I had blown it so badly and, at first, I was upset to have wasted so much time. But as time passed, I started to see the silver lining. In fact, I gained a lot of things during the period when I was preparing for the exam. In particular, I leveled up the way I set goals and organized time. Time management had been a pretty big issue for me, but in that maybe 6-month period, I had to figure out, by necessity, some unique strategies that would help me prioritize time, hit targets, and efficiently allocate hours in the day. I'd love to talk about that more if you have time, but I drew a lot of inspiration from video games, and still use many of those strategies in my work.
##### Talk about a time when you’ve gone above and beyond the requirements of the job. 
Tip: 
There's a way to say this without bragging. The best approach is to simply explain your example, and let the details reveal your ability to do more than required. In other words: 'show, don't tell'. Remember, examples are your key to interview success, and choosing the right examples means you don't need to use a lot of colorful language, which might sound like arrogance.

> [!Info] Example answer:
> A few years ago when I was working at the hostel, there was a bit of a crisis. Someone had made a huge mistake and overbooked the hostel, so when guests showed up expecting a room, they found out none were available. The owner of the hostel texted everyone on staff asking if anyone could come and help convert several of the spare rooms into guest rooms. It was my day off, but of course, I came to help. I didn't think twice about it, because the hotel was important to me, and I couldn't bear the idea of something happening which might lead to bad guest experiences. I took the hotel's reputation very seriously. Anyway, we worked for 8 hours straight to convert the rooms, and in the end, all the guests were happy. That was my reward, and also, I think it's fun to work with cool people on big challenges. There were no discussions about extra pay or anything like that. It was a real community thing.
##### What have you done to further your knowledge in the field? 
Tip: 
You should always be working to learn more about your field. It could include reading, courses (like this one), training camps, or perhaps a deeper passion related to the field. Simply explain what you do.

> [!Info] Example answer:
> Apart from attending regular seminars and conferences in online marketing, I'm constantly reading books about marketing, demographics, business strategies, or new tools and techniques related to the field. Because it’s an ever-changing area, it’s important to always be on the ball, and always keep learning. You can’t stay still for a moment.

## 39. Questions About Character and Knowledge
**How to answer these questions:**
Giving examples from the past may be a little more difficult for these questions since they are a bit more abstract. Hypotheticals are powerful for many of these questions. That means, using 'would' to explain ideas. Remember to still give clear details, and show your best side without showing arrogance.
##### What would your previous employers say about you? 
Tip: 
You can mix hypotheticals and past examples in this answer. Say exactly how you feel previous employers would talk about you, then give a specific example from your previous working experience.

> [!Info] Example answer:
> It's hard to be objective about that kind of thing, but I think they would regard me as very trustworthy. My last boss, who was the owner of the small hotel where I worked, always looked to me to resolve problems, even when he wasn't there. He pulled me aside on several occasions and told me that he felt the hotel was in good hands with me, so it's not an exaggeration for me to say that. In fact, I think there's a lot inside trustworthiness. If you have someone's trust, especially when it comes to a business, it means they see you as someone who is competent, stable, and perhaps most importantly, someone who will be honest and do the right thing when it really counts.
##### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
Tip: 
This question is highly subjective and certainly hypothetical. Focus on something ambitious yet achievable. In this answer, it's OK to be vague and less detailed. Generally, it's a good idea to ensure that the vision you have for yourself suggests that you could still be with this company.

> [!Info] Example answer:
> I'd like to be the leader of a great team with awesome performance and it may sound cheesy, but I really want to be genuinely happy with whatever I'm doing. Job satisfaction is the most important thing when it comes to my career. Personally speaking, I would like to be doing meaningful work that gives me a sense of pride, so that I'm excited to come to work every day. I think by then I will have come a long way in terms of my knowledge of the field, and my expertise.
##### Tell me something about this company. 
Tip: 
Rely on your research. You should know about the culture of the company, the philosophy, and some other specifics. It's a good idea to connect your own goals to the goals of the company.

> [!Info] Example answer:
> The community and culture of Company A are legendary--these are things I want to be part of. This company is all about open communication from top to bottom, and that really resonates with how I prefer to work. If everyone is honest, regardless of position, politics don't get in the way of productivity. It's one of the main reasons I'm applying here. In terms of the mission, 'we bring the world to you', I would love to do my part to make sure that vision is carried forward. This company is for people who care deeply about travel and creating unique experiences with a focus on quality and professionalism. I think my extensive travel background and my own desire to do great work no matter where I am, give me the right stuff to join Company A.
##### What does teamwork mean to you? Do you work well in a team? 
Tip: 
Your answer should not focus on anything that could come across an inability to work well with others. Focus on details and examples that show your ability to either collaborate or handle shared tasks.

> [!Info] Example answer:
> Here's my view of teamwork. A good team is a single unit made up of individual skill sets that, if organized correctly, allow for targets to be achieved more quickly and effectively than if each person were working in isolation. As a leader of a team, which I have experience with, you need to figure out what everyone is able to do well, what everyone is able to offer the project, and what they shouldn't be doing.
> 
> To best utilize individual strengths, it's important to assign each team member goal-oriented tasks, but also to make sure that those tasks don't overlap, and that they, together, move the ball forward. The big picture has to be at the forefront. Open channels of communication are also essential. If people in the team are always talking, the shared goal is strengthened, and nobody is stepping on anyone else's feet.
> 
> Am I a team player? Absolutely. It's really rewarding to share ideas, discuss solutions, and feel part of something larger than myself. Honestly, there are times when you have you swallow your pride and follow the lead of someone you don't necessarily agree with, but that's just part of team dynamics. I've made lasting friendships with colleagues from both small and large teams throughout my career. I believe working with a team is the most rewarding kind of work.
##### Is there any kind of person you can’t work with? 
Tip: 
Rather than focusing on a particular kind of person you refuse to work with, discuss characteristics that you find counterproductive or abrasive. Focus on the characteristics rather than your own unwillingness. If you can, show a positive characteristic about yourself within the answer.

> [!Info] Example answer:
> I don't particularly enjoy working with lazy people, and I'm sure most people would agree with that. I'm a bit of a perfectionist and I work hard no matter what I do, so a colleague unwilling to do their part really only creates more work for everyone else, in most cases. As a team, we have to hit goals and deadlines, regardless of who does the work, so whenever I work with someone who hangs back and does as little work as possible, I'm usually the one to pick up the slack and get it done. It can be frustrating.
##### Why do you think you’re a good fit here? 
Tip: 
This question can also reflect your knowledge of the company's culture or values, which makes research very important. Focus on how your own goals align with those of the company you're applying to. You may also focus on shared values.

> [!Info] Example answer:
> This company is driven by innovation. I believe that innovation, working on the cutting edge, is what really brings about a better future. But most companies just follow trends and make short-term decisions for short-term profits. This company has vision and high ambition. I want to be in a place where my knowledge and skills can be fully utilized, a place that shares my values, my emphasis on being right at the cutting edge, which, in spite of being dangerous, is the most exciting place to be. So, that's one of the reasons I think I would be a great fit here.
##### What motivates you? What gets you up in the morning?
Tip: 
This answer is a chance for you to talk about your passion. Give details that reflect your positive characteristics.

> [!Info] Example answer:
> I am driven by a strong feeling that I should do something important in the world, or make some kind of contribution. That sounds quite abstract, but I believe small actions can lead to profound consequences down the road. Once I was given the task of creating a training regiment for new staff in an online education company. Now, consider all the applicants who have come through that program. Thousands. Tens of thousands. So, my work has had a direct impact on the entire trajectory of that company, and that's something I'm quite proud of. Yes, it may not be world-changing, but that drive to make a difference gives me a sense of purpose and a passion for my work.
##### Do you have any mentors? 
Tip: 
For this answer, don't just say yes. Talk about one or two of your mentors and be sure to explain in clear detail why they have been so important to you. Generally, this should be someone you know or knew in the past, but could potentially be a person you deeply admire.

> [!Info] Example answer:
> Even though I've never met her, I draw a lot of inspiration from Rosa Parks. As you probably know, Rosa Parks was the mother of the civil rights movement and her life was an amazing demonstration of the idea that simple actions at the right time can have huge consequences. It's important to keep that in mind, and something I think about whenever I have decisions to make in my personal life or in my career that might affect the people around me. The other thing about Rosa that continues to inspire me is that she did what she did in spite of her environment. People don't think about that a lot. It takes a lot of courage to go against the grain and do the right thing, no matter what. Throughout my career, she's been the role model I look to when I have tough decisions to make. I imagine asking her what she would do, and the answer I imagine always gives me clarity. She has been a guiding star for me in more ways than one.
##### How do you handle work pressure? 
Tip: 
It's very important to consider such questions before the interview. That doesn't mean memorizing an answer, but you should consider your method for handling stress so that it doesn't sound like you're just throwing out random ideas on the day of the interview.

> [!Info] Example answer:
> My way of dealing with pressure is to keep the big picture in mind. If something unexpected happens, or I am given a sudden challenge that seems beyond my ability to handle, I start by taking a 5-minute break. I go to the window and focus on putting things into perspective. This is a challenge, yes, but if I fail, it's not the end of the world, and it's certainly not worth sacrificing my health or happiness. Spending that 5 minutes allows me to center myself, and then I'm calm when tackling whatever daunting thing may be ahead. Doing this usually leads to much better results. Also, a calm mind is more creative and clear.
> 
> Another strategy is to fragment tasks into manageable pieces. By focusing on each task, the whole thing doesn't seem so scary. I once wrote an entire school learning curriculum. Looking at the whole thing was like looking up at a mountain. But after properly breaking the project into pieces, it ended up being both manageable and much easier than I had first imagined.
##### What would your past coworkers say about you?
Tip: 
Remember to speak hypothetically and without total confidence (I think they might say...). Expressing their views absolutely can come across as arrogant and somewhat reckless.

> [!Info] Example answer:
> I would say they consider me to be a fun person who is easy to get along with, but who is also very serious about work. My personality is like that. I love telling jokes and making people laugh. Being goofy allows the workplace to be light, but at the same time when it comes to getting work done, they know I want to work hard and never compromise on quality. And because I'm working hard, they want to do the same. So, I think they would say that I encourage my colleagues to do a great job and put in their best effort, and I do that by example.
##### What makes you uncomfortable?
Tip: 
For this question, be honest but it's not a good idea to say something that makes you less attractive as a candidate. Say something minor.

> [!Info] Example answer:
> In fact, I feel somewhat uncomfortable when I'm not sure what is expected of me. It's not that I fear uncertainty, it's that I always want to do quality work, and when I am not sure the criteria by which my work will be measured, it's hard for me to properly set goals and make sure I am moving in the right direction.
##### What are your hobbies?
Tip: 
Your hobbies suggest a lot about what kind of person you are. If you are adventurous and love the outdoors, that's one thing. If you enjoy staying at home and reading, that's another. It may be a good idea to talk about two hobbies which show different characteristics about yourself.

> [!Info] Example answer:
> I'm really into reading. I read over 30 books a year, and the reason for that is my insatiable curiosity. Typically I am reading books about business and personal development, but I'm also interested in science, history, and books about the human condition. I think reading is like a shortcut for gaining experience. Reading is a way to live someone else's life, and through that, to become a more capable person. Besides reading, I am crazy about hiking. I go out for hikes once or twice a week at the very least, and love the fresh air and exercise.

##### How would you deal with a furious customer? 
Tip: 
Hypothetical questions may be the most important component of certain interviews. They allow the interviewer to understand and evaluate your current abilities and judgment. Make sure you're mentally ready for such questions.

> [!Info] Example answer:
> If a furious customer were shouting at me, for whatever reason, I would ask questions rather than arguing. Arguments lead to more conflict, and things just escalate. That doesn't work. I would remain calm and just keep the questions coming. By doing that, I'd allow the customer to get it out of their system, and at the same time, I'd be showing them my genuine concern for their issue. Once it's all out in the open, and they have calmed down somewhat, we can start working on solutions.

##### Other common hypothetical questions: 
- How would you resolve a conflict between colleagues?
- What would you do if you were blamed for something that wasn't your fault?
- What would you do if you were asked to do something by your boss that you thought was wrong? 
- How would you react if you were given a task that didn't fall within your skillset or experience? 
- If you were the manager of a team and one of your team members was often late, what would you do?
- If you discovered somebody in your team doing something unethical, what would you do?
